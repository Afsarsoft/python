Ready for more hands-on, step-by-step Python fundamentals? Add to the foundational experience you got in the Introduction to Python:
 Absolute Beginner, and explore data structures. Get lots of practice working with sample code in Jupyter Notebooks on Azure, 
which require only a browser and an Internet connection.
Focus on Python data structures, and work with string, list, and range sequences. Discover the power of list iteration, 
and learn about string and list methods. From there, get the details on file input and output—open files, read them, add to them,
 close them, and more. At the end of the course, you’ll be able to slice strings into substrings, create lists, iterate through them, 
import files, and use file append mode, along with a lot of other practical Python tasks, as you get started coding.

I’ve been working for Microsoft as a full-time employee since November 1998. Previously, 
I worked at Microsoft for approximately two years as a contractor/vendor. Currently, I lead the 
infrastructure and data architecture teams for Finance Business Intelligent group. I’m super excited for Azure,
 especially since nowadays Azure supports Open Source technologies. I am sharing here some of my Azure and Growth Mindset learning.
 I hope, this information is helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
